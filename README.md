### Extract Nanobody Sequences from multiple DNA sequencing results (fasta files) and allign them

Binder is a service to take a Github repo with Jupyter Notebooks and host it (and its requirements) on a server.

Start this repo on binder, then upload your folder with fasta files under data.
In the notebook update the folder name, and run cells.

You can also share the binder version of your repo as a link. The website is https://mybinder.org/.
